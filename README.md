Learning Device Drivers Repository
Welcome to my Learning Device Drivers repository! Here, I've included all the device drivers that I've implemented as part of my journey into embedded Linux and kernel development. It's been an exciting learning experience, and I'm thrilled to share my progress with you.

Included Device Drivers
Character Device Driver:
Implemented read, write, lseek, init, and exit functions.
How to Use
Feel free to explore and use these device drivers for your own learning and development projects. You can also refer to the code for educational purposes and as a starting point for your own implementations.
Contributing
If you have any valuable resources or suggestions to aid my embedded Linux learning journey, please feel free to share them. Your contributions and feedback are much appreciated.
